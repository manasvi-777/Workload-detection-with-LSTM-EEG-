# Workload level detection with-LSTM-EEG

Developed a deep learning model to classify EEG signals into workload levels. The pipeline included preprocessing EEG data, creating overlapping time-series epochs, and training a bidirectional LSTM in PyTorch. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROCâ€“AUC curves, achieving robust multi-class classification results.

Dataset used: STEW dataset for EEG signals
